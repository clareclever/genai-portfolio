2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## 📦 Install Dependencies

After forking and cloning the repository, you need to install the required dependencies.

1. Navigate into the local repository:

   ```bash
   cd genai-portfolio
   ```

2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   _💡 Note: Ensure that you have Python and `pip` installed on your system. You can check by running `python --version` and `pip --version`. If not installed, refer to [Python's installation guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)._

## 🔍 Open the Repository

Open the forked repository in your favorite code editor.

## 🔑 Add Your Gemini API Key

1. [Get a free Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Inside the **.streamlit** folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`. If this folder doesn’t exist, create it manually.
3. Add the following line to the file, replacing `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

   ```toml
   API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
   ```

## ▶️ Run the Application

As you customize your portfolio, you can run it locally to preview changes.

1. In your terminal, navigate to the repository directory.
2. Run this command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```

3. If successful, you'll see a message like this:

   ```bash
   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

   Local URL: http://localhost:8501
   Network URL: http://10.0.0.47:8501
   ```

4. Open the local URL in your browser to view your portfolio! 🌐🎉

_💡 Troubleshooting: If you encounter an error while running the app, ensure all dependencies are installed and that your API key is correctly set up._

Make it **yours** by updating these files:

### 📸 Assets

- **assets/images/Headshot.png**: Replace with a picture of yourself.
- **assets/data/Resume.pdf**: Upload a PDF version of your resume.
- **assets/data/Resume.txt**: Replace with plain text from your resume.

### 🏠 Homepage Content

- **Home.py**:
  - Adjust the title and markdown text with your personal details.
  - Update the `LINKEDIN_LINK`, `EMAIL_LINK`, and `GITHUB_LINK` variables to reflect your accounts.

### ❓ Q&A Page Content

- **Q&A.py**:
  - Update the `FIRST_NAME` variable with your first name to personalize predefined questions.

## 🚀 Publish Your Repository on GitHub

1. In your terminal, while inside the repository directory, run these commands:

   ```bash
   # Remove original remote URL
   git remote remove origin

   # Add YOUR GitHub repository as the new remote URL (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/genai-portfolio.git

   # Push changes to your new GitHub repository
   git push -u origin master
   ```

_💡 Why remove the original remote? This ensures that your repository points to your fork instead of the original repository._
